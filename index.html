    </h3>
    <p>
      @Scale is a series of technical conferences for engineers who build or maintain systems that are designed for scale. Building applications and services that scale to millions or even billions of people presents a complex set of engineering challenges, many of them unprecedented. The @Scale community is focused on bringing people together to openly discuss these challenges and collaborate on the development of new solutions.
